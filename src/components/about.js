                <p>The Prime Minister's Veterans' Employment Program demonstrates the importance the Government places on raising awareness with employers,
                   both private and public sector, of the value and unique experience of our veterans.</p>
                <p>Members of the Australian Defence Force (ADF) gain an extensive range of skills, abilities, recognised behaviours and attributes that
                   make them valuable employees in the civilian workforce. They possess skills such as problem-solving, leadership, team work and the ability
                   to work in high-pressure environments, just to name a few. Many former members continue to live by core ADF values such as honesty, honour,
                   initiative, integrity, respect and loyalty. These attributes are an asset to any employer.</p>
                <p>The Program will also work with industry to embed veterans' employment programs in their recruitment strategies.</p>
                <h2>Initiatives</h2>
                <h4>Industry Advisory Committee on Veterans' Employment</h4>
                <p>The <a href="">Industry Advisory Committee</a>
                  on Veterans' Employment will develop and provide advice on practical measures to embed veterans' employment strategies into the recruitment
                  practices of Australian business. The Committee will play a role in the broader promotion of the skills and professional attributes that veterans
                  have to offer employers. Advisory Committee members will be known as 'Veteran Employment Ambassadors'. Interested firms are encouraged to apply to be members
                  of the Advisory Committee. The Government will assist to set up the Advisory Committee which will transition to become an industry led committee.
                  The first meeting will occur in the first half of 2017 and will be chaired by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Defence Personnel.
