                <p>
                   Despite the heavy investment in our former servicemen and women, too often they are finding it difficult to get a job when they leave the Australian Defence Force (ADF).
                   This demonstrates that Australian businesses are not fully recognising the value that veterans can bring to their business, and they are missing out on hiring these
                   skilled and capable individuals to fill their vacancies.
                </p>
                <p>The Program aims to promote awareness of the benefits of employing veterans to ensure that Australian businesses can reap the benefits of their service in the ADF.</p>


                <h2>Benefits of employing veterans</h2>

                <p>Members of the ADF gain an extensive range of skills, abilities, recognised behaviours and attributes that make them valuable employees in the civilian workforce.
                   They are good at solving problems, leading teams, and working under pressure.  They retain core ADF values such as honesty, honour, initiative, integrity, respect and loyalty.
                   These attributes make them valuable employees in the civilian workforce.
                </p>
                <p>
                   Their talents are readily transferable to the civilian workforce and include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>learning new skills quickly</li>
                  <li>being highly motivated and punctual</li>
                  <li>communicating effectively to keep people informed</li>
                  <li>completing tasks efficiently and on time</li>
                  <li>working independently and as part of a team</li>
                  <li>demonstrating leadership but also being able to follow instructions</li>
                  <li>being well presented and courteous</li>
                  <li>working with a variety of people from different backgrounds and with varying levels of experience</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Many former ADF members will have acquired professional or trade qualifications that are recognised in the civilian workforce,
                   for example mechanics, health professionals, carpenters and drivers.
                </p>

                <h2>Industry Advisory Committee on Veterans’ Employment </h2>
                 <p>The Industry Advisory Committee on Veterans’ Employment has been established under the Program to develop and provide advice on practical measures
                   to embed veterans’ employment strategies into the recruitment practices of Australian businesses.
                 </p>

                 <h2>Ex-service Organisation Industry Partnership Register</h2>
                 <p>Employers will also benefit from the establishment of the Ex-service Organisation Industry Partnership Register. </p>
                 <p>This Register will enable ex-service organisations to register their interest in partnering with industry on projects to promote the employment of veterans.
                    Employers will be able to access this information when they are seeking a partner to assist in the creation of employment opportunities for veterans, including in regional and remote areas of the country.
                  </p>
                  <p>The Register will be launched later in 2017.</p>



                <h2>Advertising jobs to our veterans</h2>

                <p>The Australian Government provides a free jobs board on the Jobactive website, open to all employers, to advertise their vacancies.
                   It has been enhanced to allow employers to indicate that they prefer applicants with ADF experience.
                   Veterans can access the site and search specifically for jobs with 'Defence Force Experience Desirable'.
                </p>
                <p>Employers can also approach local Jobactive, Transition to Work or Disability Employment Service providers to list vacancies aimed at veterans on their behalf.
                   Employers need to register online at jobactive.gov.au, and instructions about listing vacancies and using the 'Defence Force Experience Desirable' flag are available.
                </p>
