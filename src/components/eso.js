                <p>Ex-service organisations can participate in the Prime Minister’s Veterans’
                   Employment Program through the Ex-Service Organisation Industry Partnership Register.
                   The Register is being created to record the details of ex-service organisations that are
                   interested in partnering with industry to promote the employment of veterans. </p>

                <p>Businesses who are considering projects that will create or enhance employment
                   opportunities for veterans will be able to access the Register to identify interested
                  organisations to work with them. </p>

                <p>The Register will be launched later in 2017.</p>
