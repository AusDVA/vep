                <p>Veterans have a lot to offer an employer after they separate from the Australian Defence Force (ADF).</p>
                <p>The ADF invests heavily in developing the skills and capabilities of their servicemen and women,
                   providing them with extensive training and unique work experience. As a result, they possess a range
                   of skills, abilities and attributes that make them valuable employees in the civilian workforce. They
                   are strong leaders, resilient and highly motivated, and work well in team and high-pressure environments.
                </p>
                <p>The Australian Government is committed to ensuring that veterans are provided with a range of employment
                   options when they separate, to support their smooth transition into civilian life.</p>
