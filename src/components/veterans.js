                <p>Veterans have a lot to offer an employer after they separate from the Australian Defence Force (ADF).</p>
                <p>The ADF invests heavily in developing the skills and capabilities of their servicemen and women,
                   providing them with extensive training and unique work experience. As a result, they possess a range
                   of skills, abilities and attributes that make them valuable employees in the civilian workforce. They
                   are strong leaders, resilient and highly motivated, and work well in team and high-pressure environments.
                </p>
                <p>The Australian Government is committed to ensuring that veterans are provided with a range of employment
                   options when they separate, to support their smooth transition into civilian life.</p>
                <h2 id="jobactive">jobactive</h2>
                <p>jobactive is the Australian Government’s way to get more Australians into work,
                   by connecting job seekers with employers. Under the Program, jobactive has been enhanced.</p>
                <p>The <a href="http://www.jobactive.gov.au/">jobactive website</a> now enables employers
                   to select an optional ‘defence force experience desirable’ flag, and veterans
                  can search for jobs that employers have flagged.</p>
